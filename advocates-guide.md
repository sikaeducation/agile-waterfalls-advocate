# Advocate's Guide

* Start a timer at the beginning
* Open with one of these questions
* Keep it conversational (you can ask follow-ups), but try to limit how much you talk
* Choose the questions semi-randomly
* End the conversation if they make a mistake, and don't let them try again for another half hour (see the rubric)
* End the conversation once they've answered at least 4 questions and talked for at least 2 minutes

## So you don't plan?

* Agile planning has smaller scope and timeline than traditional planning
* Agile reflects the reality that 

## What if we've invested a lot in our tools?

* Previous investments are sunk costs
* Using tools doesn't generate value by itself
* The tools are supposed to serve us, not the other way around
* A tool is only as useful as the interactions between people that they enable

## Isn't everyone doing everything inefficient?

* Everyone isn't doing everything all the time
* The efficiency that functional silos appear to offer are usually offset by issues with batching
* People have specialties, the point is to get away from throwing work over the fence or "that's not my job"

## So you just ship crap?

* Agile work is half, not half-assed
* Complete features mean the work is tested, styled, refactored, deployed and ready to provide value
* The work is delivered incrementally instead of all at once, which increases confidence and enables communication

## What if my customer is too busy to collaborate?

* The less engaged your customer is, the longer the feedback loop is
* Agile is difficult to do with a disengaged customer
* Not every deal is worth the revenue
* Agile can deliver more in less time than waterfall, but your customer has to be willing to work with you

## How do you manage scope?

* Scope is managed in much smaller increments than in traditional planning
* Agile welcomes change- doing what's valuable is more important than doing what's planned or agreed upon
* Hourly billing is often at odds with agile scope management, but there are many other billing models

## How is the way you respond to change different from how waterfall responds to change?

* Waterfall generally requires a renegotiation of the contract via a change request form
* Agile change can be responded to much more readily
* Agile development is based on current priority, which is easy to change
* Waterfall development is based on a long-established plan, which may not reflect a current reality

### Why should I use agile?

* Agile teams tend to get more work done in less time
* The quality of solutions increases due to the cross-functional nature of the teams
* Customer involvement means fewer surprises and a higher likelihood that the final product meets their needs

### Doesn't agile mean no documentation?

* Agile holds that working software is more valuable than documentation, but that doesn't mean no documentation
* In waterfall, teams don't know what documentation they'll need, so they default to documenting everything
* Documentation doesn't directly add value to the customer
* Documentation rarely keeps up to date with changes in the software

### So you don't negotiate contracts?

* You negotiate contracts, but deprioritize this in favor of collaborating
* Rather than negotiating the cost and time of every change, you set up your contracts and billing to accomodate rapid change
* Agile relationships rely heavily on mutual trust and mutual benefit

### What if our customers really want to see our long-term plans?

* Customers actually care about value, not plans to create value
* Agile delivers value frequently, which should built mutual trust
* Customers have the advantage of being able to change their minds or shift focus as the project develops

### So the customer can change their mind any time they want?

* When a customer changes their mind, they do it because they think it will make the product better
* Any proposed changes need to be prioritized against the rest of the work to be done
* Depending on the agile framework being used, changes may have to wait until the end of an iteration

## There are no contracts in agile?

* Agile relationships rely heavily on mutual trust and mutual benefit
* There are contracts, but they allow for rapid change and flexible scope
* Agile realigns incentives for mutual benefit, making it less critical to nail down every detail in a contract

## How do you start if you don't know where you're going?

* Lack of concrete plans doesn't mean lack of vision
* The further out a scope or time horizon is, the fuzzier it should be
* Agile prioritizes delivering value as early and often as possible, so you start by finding out the simplest, most impactful way to do that

## How do decisions get made with all of this collaboration?

* Collaboration doesn't necessarily mean that everyone is an equal decision maker
* In general, decisions are made by the person doing the work
* Different agile frameworks have different tools for team decision-making, but ultimately, the customer's decision is the most important
