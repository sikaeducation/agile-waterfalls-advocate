# Waterfall's Advocate

To successfully complete this drill, you need to able to sustain an argument with Waterfall's Advocate for 2 minutes. It's a conversation, so it can go in a lot of different directions. Any of these questions in particular are fair game:

* So you don't plan?
* What if we've invested a lot in our tools?
* Isn't everyone doing everything inefficient?
* So you just ship crap?
* What if my customer is too busy to collaborate?
* How do you manage scope?
* How is the way you respond to change different from how waterfall responds to change?
* Why should I use agile?
* Doesn't agile mean no documentation?
* So you don't negotiate contracts?
* What if our customers really want to see our long-term plans?
* So the customer can change their mind any time they want?
* There are no contracts in agile?
* How do you start if you don't know where you're going?
* How do decisions get made with all of this collaboration?

To pass, you need to maintain the conversation for a minimum of 2 minutes and answer a minimum of 4 questions (chosen by Waterfall's Advocate). You will be instantly disqualified if you freeze up, say you don't know the answer, or give an incorrect or irrelevant answer.
